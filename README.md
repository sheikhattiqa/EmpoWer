## Design Statement

*How might we improve the gender gap in the workplace so that women can receive better/more representation and drive more girls to field that they would otherwise not choose?*

## Project Overview

Create a Reddit style forum where women in technology are able to communicate with one another, this forum will also encourage younger girls to seek mentors and/or resources to get to know what it is like to be a woman in any field (Finance, Medicine, Tech, Humanities, Business). Main goal: facilitate a discussion.
