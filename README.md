## Design Statement

*How might we improve the gender gap in the workplace so that women can receive better/more representation and drive more girls to field that they would otherwise not choose?*

## Project Overview

Create a Reddit style forum where women in technology are able to communicate with one another, this forum will also encourage younger girls to seek mentors and/or resources to get to know what it is like to be a woman in any field (Finance, Medicine, Tech, Humanities, Business). Main goal: facilitate a discussion.

**Focused Questions**
How will our solution solve t*he gender gap in technology*?
Who is it for? 
What differentiates our solution from existing solutions?
How does our design work?

-Most solutions/groups are only focused on one industry

-Women-made

-Forum and resources combined, whereas Reddit is only forum-based

-Our website provides resources/connections with all industries

-Follows women's narrative

-Anyone can join
